   - Activity Log
  
     The Activity Log is helpful in the search and monitoring of performance, diagnostic, health logs and so many more as seen below
     
     These logs help you monitor

   - Access Control (IAM)
  
     Azure Container Apps use  Access Control to manage access permissions. You can assign built-in or custom roles to users, groups, or service principals to control who can view, deploy, or manage container         apps.
     Access is granted by assigning roles at the subscription, resource group, or resource level.
     
     - Role	Permissions
     - Owner	Full access to manage everything, including access control
     - Contributor	Can create and manage resources but not assign roles
     - Reader	Can view resources but not make changes
     - Container App Contributor	Can manage container apps but not environments or access control

   - Tag

     Azure Container Apps support tagging at the resource level, allowing you to organize, manage, and track costs across your cloud environment. Tags are key-value pairs that help categorize resources.
     Tags in Azure Container App are metadata elements you attach to resources. Each tag consists of a name (key) and a value, such as below,
     
     - Container App resources
       
     - Container App environments
       
     - Resource organization
       
     - Billing and cost management
     
     - Automation and policy enforcement

   - Diagnose And Solve Problem
  
     Azure Container Apps includes a built-in “Diagnose and solve problems” tool in the Azure Portal that helps you troubleshoot common issues like deployment failures, scaling delays, and connectivity problems.
     This tool provides guided diagnostics for your container app. It automatically checks for common issues and offers actionable insights based on your app’s configuration and runtime behavior.Some                  troubleshooting Tips:View Console Logs, Check Revision Status, Verify Image Accessibility, and Use Azure Monitor.
  
     - Error deploying new revision
     - Provisioning delays
     - Ingress issues
     - Scaling problems
     - Container crashes or restarts

   - Resource Visualizer
  
     Azure Container Apps can be visualized using the Azure Resource Visualizer, a tool in the Azure Portal that automatically generates interactive diagrams of your cloud resources and their relationships.
     Azure Resource Visualizer is a built-in feature that helps you understand the architecture of your deployed resources—including Azure Container Apps—by showing how they connect to other services like             environments, registries, secrets, and monitoring tools. Some benefit for Container App Users below,
  


      - Architecture clarity: See how your app fits into the broader cloud environment.
  
     - Troubleshooting: Identify misconfigured or missing dependencies.
    
     - Security reviews: Visualize access paths and network boundaries
    
     - Documentation: Export diagrams for team sharing or compliance.
  
     - Interactive diagrams: Clickable nodes representing resources and their dependencies.
    
     - Real-time mapping: Reflects the current state of your Azure environment.
    
     - No setup required: Automatically available in the Azure Portal.
